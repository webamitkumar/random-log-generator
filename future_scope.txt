To connect your log generator to a database and store the logs in real-time, we can follow these steps:

---

### **Steps to Add Database Integration**
1. **Choose a Database:**
   - Use a relational database like **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, or a NoSQL database like **MongoDB**.
   - Here, I'll use **SQLite** for simplicity. You can scale it to any other database later.

2. **Set Up a Database Table:**
   - Define a schema to store logs.
   - Columns:
     - `id` (Primary Key, Auto Increment)
     - `timestamp` (Datetime)
     - `log_level` (Text)
     - `action` (Text)
     - `user` (Text)

3. **Modify the Code:**
   - Add a database connection using Python's `sqlite3` or other appropriate libraries (e.g., `mysql-connector-python` for MySQL).
   - Insert logs into the database whenever they are generated.
   - Also append them to the `generated_logs.txt` file for redundancy.

### **Modified Code**
Here's the updated program with database integration:

```python
import pandas as pd
import random
import logging
import string
import sqlite3
import os
from datetime import datetime

# Configure logging for errors
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

# Database connection setup
DB_FILE = "logs.db"

def setup_database():
    """Create a database table for storing logs."""
    try:
        conn = sqlite3.connect(DB_FILE)
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute("""
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS logs (
                id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
                timestamp TEXT,
                log_level TEXT,
                action TEXT,
                user TEXT
            )
        """)
        conn.commit()
        conn.close()
        print("Database setup complete.")
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error setting up the database: {e}")
        print(f"Error setting up the database: {e}")

def generate_log_entry():
    """Generate a random log entry."""

    action = random.choice(['login', 'logout', 'view', 'edit', 'delete'])
    user = ''.join(random.choices(string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits, k=6))
    return timestamp, log_level, action, user

def write_log_to_database(timestamp, log_level, action, user):
    """Insert a log entry into the database."""
    try:
        conn = sqlite3.connect(DB_FILE)
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute("""
            INSERT INTO logs (timestamp, log_level, action, user)
            VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)
        """, (timestamp, log_level, action, user))

def write_logs_to_file_and_db(log_filename, num_entries=100):
    """Generate logs and write them to both a file and the database."""
    try:
        with open(log_filename, 'w') as file:
            for _ in range(num_entries):
                timestamp, log_level, action, user = generate_log_entry()
                log_entry = f"{timestamp} - {log_level} - {action} - user: {user}"
                
                # Write to file
                file.write(log_entry + '\n')
                
                # Write to database
                write_log_to_database(timestamp, log_level, action, user)
                
        print(f"Logs have been successfully written to {log_filename} and the database.")
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error writing logs to file and database: {e}")
        print(f"Error writing logs to file and database: {e}")

def view_logs_from_database():
    """Fetch and display logs from the database."""
    try:
        conn = sqlite3.connect(DB_FILE)
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM logs")
        rows = cursor.fetchall()
        conn.close()
        
        print("\nLogs from Database:")
        for row in rows:
            print(row)
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error fetching logs from database: {e}")
        print(f"Error fetching logs from database: {e}")

# Main Script Execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    log_filename = "generated_logs.txt"
    
    # Step 1: Setup database
    setup_database()
    
    # Step 2: Generate logs and store in file and database
    write_logs_to_file_and_db(log_filename, num_entries=200)
    
    # Step 3: View logs from database (optional)
    view_logs_from_database()
```

### **What This Code Does**
1. **Database Setup (`setup_database`):**
   - Creates a table `logs` in a SQLite database file (`logs.db`) to store log entries.

2. **Generate Logs (`generate_log_entry`):**
   - Creates a log with a timestamp, log level, action, and user ID.

3. **Write Logs (`write_logs_to_file_and_db`):**
   - Logs are written to:
     - **File:** Appends logs to `generated_logs.txt`.
     - **Database:** Inserts the logs into the SQLite database.

4. **View Logs (`view_logs_from_database`):**
   - Fetches and displays logs stored in the database.

---

### **How It Works**
- Each log is written to the text file **and** stored in the database simultaneously.
- You can analyze logs directly from the database for real-time insights.

---

### **How to Run This Code**
1. Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `log_generator_with_db.py`).
2. Run the script:
   ```
   python log_generator_with_db.py
   ```
3. Check the output:
   - Logs will be saved in `generated_logs.txt`.
   - Logs will also be stored in `logs.db` (SQLite database).

4. Use a database viewer (e.g., **DB Browser for SQLite**) to explore the `logs.db` file.

### **Future Enhancements**
- Connect to a cloud database (e.g., AWS RDS, Azure SQL) for real-time scalability.
- Build a live monitoring dashboard using **Flask** or **Django** with logs fetched directly from the database.
